# Runic.jl changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
### Added
 - New command line argument `--verbose` which enables verbose output ([#121]).
### Changed
 - Runic is now silent by default. Use `--verbose` to enable the verbose file progress
   printing from previous releases ([#121]).

## [v1.2.0] - 2024-12-09
### Added
 - New command line option `--lines=a:b` for limiting formatting to lines `a` to `b`.
   `--lines` can be repeated to specify multiple ranges ([#114], [#120]).

## [v1.1.0] - 2024-12-04
### Changed
 - Fix a bug that caused "single space after keyword" to not apply after the `function`
   keyword in non-standard function definitions ([#113]). This bug is classified as a
   [spec-bug] and the fix will result in diffs like the following:
   ```diff
   -function()
   +function ()
        # ...
    end
   ```
 - Fix a bug that caused "single space after keyword" to not apply after `let` ([#117]).
   This bug is classified as a [spec-bug] and the fix will result in diffs like the
   following when `let` is followed by multiple spaces (which should be rare) in the source:
   ```diff
   -let  a = 1
   +let a = 1
        a
    end
   ```
 - Fix formatting of whitespace in between `let`-variables ([#118]). This bug is classified
   as a [spec-bug] and the fix will result in diffs like the following in rare cases where
   e.g. multiple spaces, or spaces *before* comma, is used in the variable list:
   ```diff
   -let  a = 1,  b = 2
   +let  a = 1, b = 2
        a + b
    end
   ```
 - Fix a bug that caused multiline variable blocks in `let` to not indent correctly ([#97],
   [#116]). This bug is classified as a [spec-bug] and the fix will result in diffs like the
   following whenever multiline variable blocks exist in the source:
   ```diff
    let a = 1,
   -    b = 2
   +        b = 2
        a + b
    end
   ```

## [v1.0.1] - 2024-11-28
### Fixed
 - Fix an incorrect whitespace assertion in function indentation ([#109], [#110]).

## [v1.0.0] - 2024-11-06
First stable release of Runic.jl. See [README.md](README.md) for details and documentation.
